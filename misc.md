### Codes and Softwares

* **ZMSP**: The `Mingled Strucutured Predictor`. [[code]](https://github.com/zzsfornlp/zmsp) <br>
This repo currently contains the implementation of several neural dependency parsers (both graph-based and transition-based ones), semantic role labelers, as well as a simple event extraction system.

* **NNPGDParser**: Neural Network Based Probablistic Graph Dependency Parser. [[code]](https://github.com/zzsfornlp/nnpgdparser) <br>
This is the work of my ACL-2016 paper. This parser adopts tree-CRF probabilistic training criterion and Convolutional Neural Network model for the task of dependency parsing.

* **NNGDParser**: Neural Network Based Probablistic Graph Dependency Parser. [[code]](https://github.com/zzsfornlp/nngdparser) <br>
This is the predecessor of NNPGDParser and is a simple Feed-Forward Neural Network parser. It is the work of my PACLIC-29 paper.

* **TIGER-Compiler**: Compiler for the programming language of *TIGER*. [[code]](https://github.com/zzsfornlp/tiger-compiler) <br>
This is the course project of the Compiler course, and I finished a complete compiler for a mini-language *TIGER*. It accepts *TIGER* source code and generates MIPS code.
