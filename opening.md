### Opening

Hi! I am currently looking for self-motivated PhD and MPhil students (for 2026), as well as research assistants (time can be flexible).

**Research Directions**:
I'm generally interested at topics related to NLP and LLM. My current focus is mainly on long-context LM, LLM-based agent and understanding LMs ([more about my research](./research)). That said, I'm also open to related topics within the NLP/ML/AI space.

**I'm Looking For**:
I think the most essential quality for research is *self-motivation* -- it's what keeps research moving forward. I value both: *Rigor*, to ensure the work is solid and meaningful, and *Creativity*, to think beyond the obvious. A background in NLP, machine learning, or related fields is preferred. Strong coding skills are a plus. For PhD/MPhil applicants, please also ensure you meet CityU's [entrance requirements](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/pg/research-degree-programmes/entrance-requirements).

**How to Apply**:
If you're interested, please send me an email with: <br>
-- Subject line: "Application for {Position} at CityUHK - {Your Full Name}" <br>
-- Attachments: CV, a brief research statement, and any other related materials which you think will be helpful <br>
*(Due to time constraints, I may not be able to respond to all emails. Apologies for this and thanks for your understanding. Well-formatted emails are much appreciated and are very likely to receive a reply.)*
