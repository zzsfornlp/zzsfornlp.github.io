### Opening

Hi! I am currently looking for self-motivated PhD and MPhil students (for 2026), as well as research assistants (time can be flexible).

**Research Directions**:
I'm generally interested at topics related to NLP and LLM. My current focus is mainly on long-context LM, LLM-based agent and understanding LMs ([more about my research](./research)). That said, I'm also open to related topics within the NLP/ML/AI space.

**I'm Looking For**:
I think the most essential quality for research is *self-motivation* -- it's what keeps research moving forward. I value both: *Rigor*, to ensure the work is solid and meaningful, and *Creativity*, to think beyond the obvious. A background in NLP, machine learning, or related fields is preferred. Strong coding skills are a plus. For PhD/MPhil applicants, please also ensure you meet CityU's [entrance requirements](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/pg/research-degree-programmes/entrance-requirements).

**How to Apply**:
If you're interested, please send me an email with: <br>
-- Subject line: "Application for {Position} at CityUHK - {Your Full Name}" <br>
-- Attachments: CV, a brief research statement, and any other related materials which you think will be helpful <br>

*Due to time constraints, I may not be able to respond to every email or discuss with all applicants individually. Please note that the review process will take some time, and potential candidates will be contacted within two weeks for further discussions. I apologize for any inconvenience and appreciate your understanding and patience.*
