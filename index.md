## Zhisong Zhang

Hi, here is Zhisong. I'm currently an Assistant Professor in the [CS department](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/) at CityUHK.
I received my PhD from Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Before that, I graduated with BS and MS in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My current research focuses on natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs), with particular interests in long-context language modeling, LLM-based agent systems, and understanding the underlying mechanisms of language models. Please refer to [this page](./research) for more details of my research work.

*Openings: I am currently seeking self-motivated students for PhD/MPhil positions (for 2026), as well as research assistants (time can be flexible). For more details, please refer to [this page](./opening).*
